I have push the backend and frontend folder with the packages so you don't have to worry about the installation just clone the whole repo 

write 
step1 - (cd backend)  
step 2 - (npm run start)

and open another terminal and write 
step1 - (cd frontend)  
step 2 - (npm run dev)

it will connect to the server of the backend and will run if disn't then go to vite.config.js
and in the server->proxy write the localhost your localmachine is on and then it will work
